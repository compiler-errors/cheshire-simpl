# What is Cheshire?

Cheshire is a programming language project I'm using to study writing compilers
in Rust. I am conducting this project in my CS 81 class at Caltech, and Hopefully
by the end of the project, I'll have a simple programming language with a few types,
type inference, and which targets LLVM for CPU support.

Future features include:
* Objects
* Packages
* Traits + Generics
